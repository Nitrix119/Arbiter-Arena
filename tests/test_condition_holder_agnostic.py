"""Condition riders install on the conditioned entity, holder-agnostic.

SPELL_SYSTEM_REMAINING §3.2: the reactive rule for a condition no longer bakes
``holder: "defender"`` into its trigger. ``apply_condition`` installs the rider on a
child invocation whose caster/target *are* the conditioned entity, so the default
``holder: "caster"`` binds ``entity`` correctly whether the spell conditions its target
or itself. Two things this must not break, and one it must newly get right:

- **Regression guard** — Charm Person's ``bindings: {charmer: "event.caster"}`` must
  still resolve to the *caster*, even though the rider now installs with caster = the
  charmed creature. The bindings are pre-resolved against the cast invocation.
- **The previously-latent case** — a condition applied to the caster itself
  (``target: "self"``) must bind the rider to the caster.
