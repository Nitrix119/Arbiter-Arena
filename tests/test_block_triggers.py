"""Trigger blocks: reactive riders bound to events, scoped to a lifetime (§4.3a).

A trigger subscribes its ``then`` sub-program to a combat event; when the event
fires it runs against a fresh invocation carrying the event's data. Bound inside a
``lifetime`` block, the subscription is owned by the scope — teardown unsubscribes
it. See :mod:`src.spells.blocks.triggers`.
