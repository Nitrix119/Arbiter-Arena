"""`apply_condition` installs reactions, so it must flush DAMAGE_DEALT first.

The evaluator emits the cast's pending `DAMAGE_DEALT` just *before* any block that
subscribes handlers to future events, so a rider that block installs does not fire on
the very damage that cast it (`runner.run_target`). `lifetime` and `trigger` declare
`installs_reactions=True` for exactly this reason.

`apply_condition` also subscribes handlers — it installs the condition's reactive
rule — but declared `installs_reactions=False`. Latent today, because no shipped
condition rider listens on DAMAGE_DEALT and no shipped spell both damages and applies
a condition. It stops being latent the moment someone writes a bleed-style condition,
so this pins the ordering with exactly that shape.
