"""The declared expression roots must match the namespace expressions really run in.

`EXPRESSION_ROOTS` is what the validator checks an expression's top-level names
against. If it drifts from what `eval_context` actually builds, the validator either
rejects a name that works (blocking authors) or accepts one that is a NameError at
run time — swallowed inside a trigger guard as "did not fire", which is the failure
mode this whole gate exists to prevent.

So this checks the declaration against a real invocation rather than trusting it.
