"""The declared field schemas must match the args the handlers actually read.

`BlockContract.fields` is hand-written, and a hand-written schema rots: someone adds
`block.get("new_arg")` to a handler, forgets the declaration, and the validator then
*rejects* the arg they just added — or declares a field nothing reads and the
generated reference documents something that does not exist.

So this reads the code. It AST-parses every module that reads block args and collects
each literal key passed to `block.get(...)` / `block.args[...]`, then compares that set
against the union of declared field names, in both directions.

This is sound because every arg read in `src/spells/` uses a **literal string
constant** — there are no dynamic key lookups. If that ever stops being true this test
becomes incomplete rather than wrong, so `test_no_dynamic_arg_reads` guards it.

**What it is not:** a per-block check. It compares *sets of names*, because three args
are read outside their own handler (see `_CROSS_READS`). It is a drift alarm, not a
proof that block X declares exactly the args handler X reads.
