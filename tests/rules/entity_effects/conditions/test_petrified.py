"""Tests for the Petrified condition entity effect.

Petrified has two riders: the petrified creature cannot act (its declared attack is
cancelled) while attacks against it have advantage, and it takes half damage.

The damage-resistance half was mechanically dead: its DAMAGE_INCOMING trigger guarded
on ``event.attacker``, a field that event does not carry, so the guard raised
AttributeError and was swallowed as "did not fire" — indistinguishable from a
legitimate miss. Caught at load once `validate_program` checked event references
against the trigger's declared event (E6, rule side).
