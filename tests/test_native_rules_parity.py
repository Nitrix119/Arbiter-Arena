"""Native-rule invariant — the rule corpus is fully native, with no exceptions.

Every shipped ``rules/global/*`` and ``rules/entity_effects/**`` rule is authored as a
block ``program``. This guards that invariant: each rule file is native and its program
passes the load-time block validator, so a regression that re-introduces a legacy-shaped
rule (or a malformed program) fails here.
