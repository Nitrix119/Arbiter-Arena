"""Weapon-attack resolution on the block engine (the only engine).

`AttackResolver` resolves a weapon attack through the block engine (the same
`[attack_roll, damage…]` a spell uses). These tests drive the real `AttackResolver`
with controlled rolls to pin hit / miss / multi-type damage, and that a Colossus
attacker — a native ATTACK_HIT block trigger — resolves on blocks and lands its
bonus die.
