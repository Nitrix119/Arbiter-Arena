"""What an agent is allowed to know about its enemies.

The :class:`InformationPolicy` is the arena's experiment knob. An observation of
the battle always shows an agent its own entity and its allies in full; each
*enemy* is passed through the policy first, which can hide or coarsen facts such
as exact HP or AC. Because the policy is the only thing that shapes the enemy
view, an experiment ("how does hiding enemy HP change play?") is a one-line
policy change plus a batch run — no engine edits.

Position is never hidden in v1: the engine needs it for range and overlap
checks, and both agents can see the battlefield. A future "fog of war" is a
larger, separate design (see ``docs/current/AGENT_ARENA_PLAN.md`` §10).
