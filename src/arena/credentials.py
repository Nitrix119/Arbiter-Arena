"""Safe API-credential resolution for arena adapters.

Keeps API keys out of code, logs, and Git. A key is read from an environment variable if
set, otherwise from a git-ignored file under ``secrets/``. Only the running process ever
reads it — the value never passes through a command line or gets printed, so an agent (human
or Claude) can launch a match without the key entering its view.
