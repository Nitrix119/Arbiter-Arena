"""Tool schemas and the executor that turns a chosen action into a refereed effect.

This is the arena's **single execution seam** — the mirror of the web layer's
``_HANDLERS`` dispatch. An agent (LLM or scripted) proposes an action as a
:class:`ToolCall`; :class:`ToolExecutor` validates it and dispatches to the existing
``CombatSystem.resolve_attack`` / ``resolve_spell`` / ``move_entity`` / ``end_turn``.
It never resolves combat itself (CLAUDE.md §3, one resolution path) and never mutates
state directly — the engine is the authority. An illegal call is caught and returned as
a structured error the agent can react to, not a crash.

**Provider-neutral (E4).** :data:`TOOLS` are plain JSON-Schema tool definitions in the
``{name, description, input_schema}`` shape. Claude consumes them directly; another
provider's adapter reshapes only the envelope. Positions and points are in **backend
feet** — the engine's own coordinates — matching the observation.

**Resolution transparency (C3).** A success result always states the outcome (hit/miss,
save success, damage) and the acting agent's *own* roll, but the target's defensive
numbers are gated by the actor's :class:`InformationPolicy`: the target's AC (and, for a
save, the target's save-roll value) appear only when ``reveal_enemy_ac`` is set. The
spell **save DC is the actor's own** stat and is always shown; the target's resulting HP
is never in the result (the next observation carries it, gated by ``reveal_enemy_hp``).
