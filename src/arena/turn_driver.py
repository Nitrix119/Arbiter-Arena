"""Drive one entity's turn: observe → decide → act → observe, until the turn ends.

The driver calls the agent for **one** action at a time (B2), executes it through the
:class:`~src.arena.tools.ToolExecutor`, feeds the result back into the next observation,
and repeats. It stops when the agent ends its turn, or a guard trips:

* **failure budget (C2):** 3 consecutive or 5 total illegal/failed calls in a turn →
  auto-end the turn (illegal-move rate is a metric);
* **action cap:** a safety valve against an agent that acts forever without ending;
* **dead/again:** a downed actor's turn is skipped.

**Invariant:** every ``run_turn`` advances the combat exactly once — either the agent's
own ``end_turn`` (executed by the ``ToolExecutor``) or a single forced ``end_turn``.
