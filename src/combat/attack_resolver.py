"""Attack resolution on the block engine (Phase 3 — one path for weapons and spells).

A weapon attack *is* a block program: ``[attack_roll, damage…]``, the same blocks an
attack-roll spell uses, so it resolves on the one engine. A weapon is authored in the
concise flat form (``bonus_to_hit`` + a ``damage`` list) that creature JSON has always
used, and :func:`_default_program` builds its program from that; a weapon that needs
more than the default may author a ``program`` directly, exactly as a spell does.
Reactive riders (Colossus Slayer's on-hit bonus die) ride the shared EventBus as block
triggers.
