"""The block-based spell system (the rewrite).

A spell is a ``program``: an ordered, nestable list of typed **blocks** run by a
single evaluator over a per-invocation context. This package is the sole resolution
engine for spells, weapon attacks and rules alike (the legacy flat ``EffectPipeline``
and the rule engine's ``action``-verb dispatch have both been retired; see
docs/archive/SPELL_SYSTEM_BUILD_PLAN.md).

Foundations: the ``Block`` value type, the ``BlockContract`` (reads/writes/target
arity), and the ``BlockRegistry`` that replaced the old ``if/elif`` dispatch and the
second effect vocabulary with one catalogue.
