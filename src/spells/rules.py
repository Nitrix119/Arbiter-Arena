"""Load rule JSON and install it on the block engine.

A rule is a block ``program`` of ``trigger`` blocks, so installing one is the block
engine's job — these functions are the seam between the rule *data* in
:mod:`src.rules` (``Rule``, ``RuleLoader``, ``EffectRegistry``) and the engine that
runs it. Two shapes:

- **Global** (:func:`install_rule`, :func:`load_rules_from_directory`) — a rule with
  no holder, whose triggers fire for the whole combat: the concentration check,
  damage resistance/immunity/vulnerability, the crit rules, the per-turn refill.
- **Entity-scoped** (:func:`apply_entity_rule`) — a rule held by one creature: a
  feature such as Colossus Slayer, or the mechanics behind a condition. Owned by a
  ``LifetimeScope`` on that entity, so a ``duration_rounds`` rule expires on the
  holder's turn and ``Entity.remove_effect`` tears it down by name.

This replaced ``rules.RuleEngine``, which had shrunk to a loader that reached into
this package to do the installing — an inverted dependency. ``src.rules`` is now pure
data with no engine in it.
