"""Block contracts — a block's fields, what it reads and writes, how it targets.

Every block type registers a :class:`BlockContract` alongside its handler. The
contract is the single source of truth used by (a) the validator, to reject a bad
program at load, (b) the evaluator, to know each block's shape, and (c) the
generated ``docs/current/BLOCK_REFERENCE.md``.

The :class:`Field` declarations are the per-arg half: they name every arg a block
accepts, its kind and domain, and whether it is required. Anything not declared is
rejected at load — an unknown arg is silently ignored at run time, which is the worst
outcome for an author (see CLAUDE.md §2.5). Because the declarations are hand-written
they are drift-guarded by ``tests/test_block_schema_drift.py``, which reads the
handlers' actual ``block.get(...)`` calls and compares the two.

            events (``lifetime``, ``trigger``). The evaluator flushes the pending
            ``DAMAGE_DEALT`` just before the first such block so a rider does not
