"""Per-invocation state for running a block program.

One :class:`Invocation` holds everything a single program run needs: the caster,
the current (single) target, the shared mutable ``context`` dict, the combat
collaborators, and the bookkeeping the result is derived from. Sub-programs
(an iterator per element, a trigger per firing) spawn a child via
:meth:`Invocation.child`, which reuses the caster/action/collaborators and gives
the child its own seeded context — so the collaborators are threaded in one place.
