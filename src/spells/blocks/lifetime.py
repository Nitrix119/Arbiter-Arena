"""The lifetime block — wrap a `then` subtree in a scope that owns its grants.

A persistent effect is a lifetime scope around one or more grant blocks (design
§6.3). This block opens a fresh :class:`~src.models.lifetime.LifetimeScope`, makes
it the invocation's active scope while its ``then`` body runs — so every grant
inside registers its revoke handle into the scope — and then binds the scope:

- ``kind: "concentration"`` → the caster's concentration lifetime. Beginning it
  disposes any prior concentration atomically (a new spell drops the old one and
  its entire granted subtree). A failed CON save later disposes it via
  ``Entity.end_concentration`` (the global concentration rule).
- otherwise (a duration) → held on the caster's ``lifetimes`` list. No clock ticks
  durations down yet, so teardown is reserved; the scope still owns its handles.

The grant blocks themselves (``add_modifier``, ``apply_condition``,
``grant_temporary_hp``) are unchanged — they just register their handle with the
open scope when one is active (see ``blocks/state.py``).
