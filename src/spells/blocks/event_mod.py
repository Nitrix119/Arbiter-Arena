"""Event-modifier blocks — reach back onto the in-flight ``CombatEvent``.

Every block built before this one is a *forward* effect: it writes state (damage,
healing, a condition, a grant) or subscribes a rider. Event-modifier blocks are the
one category that changes a **live** event the resolver is mid-way through emitting
— ``modify_damage`` / ``grant_advantage`` / ``force_critical`` / ``cancel``. They are
the primitive the global combat rules (``rules/global/*`` — resistance, crit,
concentration) are built on.

The contract (settled — see the plan §5, "live-event mutation contract"): an
event-modifier block fires inside a ``trigger`` block, which supplies the live
event on ``Invocation.live_event``; the block writes directly onto
``live_event.data`` (or ``live_event.cancelled``) — which is what the emitter checks
after each handler. Run outside a trigger there is no live event to touch, so the
block no-ops (a fail-safe, matching the engine's skip-don't-crash stance). Contract
flag ``mutates_event=True`` marks the category.

This module ships the pure event-flag modifiers — ``modify_damage`` (damage
resistance/immunity/vulnerability rules), ``force_critical`` (nat-20/nat-1 crit
rules), and ``grant_advantage`` / ``grant_disadvantage`` / ``cancel`` (the entire
condition library: blinded, frightened, invisible, paralysed, restrained, stunned,
…). The side-effecting members (``force_concentration_check``, ``refill_resources``)
are forward effects that fire *on* an event rather than mutating it, and live in
``global_effects.py``.
