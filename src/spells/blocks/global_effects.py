"""Forward blocks the global combat rules fire.

The event-modifier blocks (``modify_damage`` / ``force_critical`` / …) *mutate* the
in-flight event; these two instead fire **on** an event and mutate an entity:

- ``force_concentration_check`` — the concentration-break rule (on ``DAMAGE_DEALT``):
  roll a CON save against a ``dc`` expression and, on a failure, end the target's
  concentration (disposing its block-engine lifetime scope identity-first).
- ``refill_resources`` — the per-turn action-economy rule (on ``TURN_START``): reset
  the target's resources to its stat-block defaults.

They are ordinary forward blocks acting on the current target; a global rule's
trigger rebinds that target to the event entity (``rebind_target: "event.defender"``
/ ``"event.entity"``). Nothing about them is intrinsically "global"; they
live together here because the two global rules are their only callers today, and can
move into ``state.py`` if a spell ever reuses them.
