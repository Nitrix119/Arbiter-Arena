"""The damage block — the superset of the legacy ``damage`` step and ``DealDamage``.

Keeps every richer semantic of the pipeline ``damage`` step: ``requires_hit``
gating, slot-based ``scaling`` (stage 2), crit-doubling, ``save_result`` half/no
damage, and routing through the DamageProcessor so resistance/immunity apply.
``DealDamage``'s flat-formula case is just this block with those options omitted —
one block, not two.

``roll_once`` AoE sharing is the *iterator's* property, not this block's: the
iterator (``blocks/iterators.py``) rolls the shared total once and seeds it here
via ``context["_shared_rolls"]``; this block only consumes a seeded total when one
is present. Single-target and non-shared damage roll normally.
