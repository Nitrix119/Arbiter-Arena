"""Trigger blocks — subscribe a `then` sub-program to a combat event.

A reactive rider (Colossus Slayer's bonus die on a hit, Vampiric Touch's heal on
the caster's necrotic damage, Armor of Agathys' retaliation) is a ``then``
sub-program bound to an EventBus event. When the ``trigger`` block runs during a
cast it captures its defining caster + collaborators, subscribes a handler, and —
if a lifetime scope is open (a concentration/duration ``lifetime`` block) —
registers the *unsubscribe* as a revoke handle the scope owns. Teardown of the
lifetime then unsubscribes the rider for free: a subscription is just another
grant (design §6.1/§6.5). Outside a lifetime the subscription is permanent (a
racial feature).

When the event fires, the handler builds a **fresh invocation** carrying the
event's data (``event.<field>`` in expressions), evaluates the optional firing
guard ``when`` (a distinct key from the evaluator's install-time ``condition``, so
the guard is checked at *fire* time against the event, not when the trigger is
installed), binds the current target from the optional ``rebind_target`` expression,
and runs ``then``. Re-entrant events (a rider whose damage triggers another rider)
are bounded by a depth guard (design §6.4) so a retaliation loop cannot recurse
without limit.
