"""State blocks: apply_condition, add_modifier, grant_temporary_hp, add_resource,
grant_action.

Each does its work **directly** — mutating the target and emitting the corresponding
event — rather than by the old pipeline's route of building a synthetic ``on_apply``
dict plus a stub SPELL_HIT event and handing it to a separate effect vocabulary. That
bridge, the clearest symptom of the two-vocabulary seam, is gone.
