"""The healing block — the superset of the legacy ``healing`` step and ``HealTarget``.

Heals the current target (or the caster with ``target: "self"``) by either an
``amount`` expression or a ``formula`` + optional ``bonus``. Mirrors the legacy
pipeline's healing step; ``HealTarget``'s formula+bonus case is this block with
``amount`` omitted.
