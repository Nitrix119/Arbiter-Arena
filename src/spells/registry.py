"""The block registry — one catalogue, dict dispatch, no ``if/elif``.

This replaced the old ``EffectPipeline`` ``if/elif`` ladder and the separate rule
``action``-verb vocabulary (both deleted) with one registry of block types.
A block type is registered once with its handler and :class:`BlockContract`;
the evaluator dispatches by name and the linter validates against the same
contract.

The block *type* catalogue is process-global by design — it is code (the
language's vocabulary), immutable after import, and shared across all battles,
unlike per-battle spell content and mutable state. Tests may still construct an
isolated :class:`BlockRegistry` instance.

# damage dealt, ``select_target`` the chosen entity. Declaring ``None`` here made
# registering either one a type error.
