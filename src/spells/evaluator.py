"""The block evaluator — the two public entry points for resolving a spell.

Builds the top-level :class:`Invocation`(s) and runs the program:

- ``resolve`` — a per-target program for one caster/target pair.
- ``resolve_program`` — the fan-out entry: a set-consuming program (a top-level
  iterator) is run once on a root invocation that fans over the target set; a flat
  per-target program is run once per target.

Actually *running* a program lives in :mod:`.runner` (``run_target`` /
``run_program``), which block handlers reuse without importing this module — the
evaluator imports the blocks package to register the catalogue, so keeping the
run primitives out of here is what avoids an import cycle.
