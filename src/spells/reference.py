"""Generate the block authoring reference from the registry itself.

``BLOCK_REFERENCE.md`` is rendered from the live block ``REGISTRY`` — each block's
handler docstring plus its :class:`BlockContract` — so the authoring docs cannot
drift from the code the loader validates against. A drift test
(``tests/test_block_reference_doc.py``) fails if the checked-in file is stale.

Regenerate with::

    python -m src.spells.reference

Everything here is authoritative: each block's args come from its `Field`
declarations, which are what the load-time validator checks against and are
themselves drift-guarded against the handlers' real `block.get` calls
(``tests/test_block_schema_drift.py``). A block cannot accept an arg this page
does not list.
