"""The Block value type — one instruction in a spell program.

A block is an immutable value: a registered ``type``, its ``args`` (the remaining
fields), and an optional ``then`` sub-program (a tuple of child blocks) that
iterator and trigger blocks run. Programs nest only through ``then`` (decided:
one nesting mechanism — see the design doc §0 / build plan).

The program shape uses ``"block"`` as the type key::

    { "block": "damage", "damage_type": "FIRE", "formula": "8d6" }
    { "block": "for_each_target", "then": [ { "block": "damage", ... } ] }

Legacy ``effects`` step-dicts (which use ``"type"``) are converted to blocks by
the loader boundary, not by this type.
