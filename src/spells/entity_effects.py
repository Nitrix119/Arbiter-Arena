"""Install a per-entity reactive rule (a creature feature) as block triggers.

The entity-effect sibling of :func:`src.spells.global_rules.install_global_rules`.
``spells.rules.apply_entity_rule`` routes a reactive rule here: the rule's ``program``
trigger blocks are subscribed on the shared event bus, with the holder bound to the
entity the effect is applied to. Colossus Slayer — a permanent ``ATTACK_HIT``
bonus-damage rider — is the canonical user.

The installed triggers are owned by a :class:`LifetimeScope` on the entity: a
``duration_rounds`` rule expires through ``Entity.tick_lifetimes`` on the holder's
turn, and ``Entity.remove_effect`` disposes the scope
by name to tear the rider down. A rider with no duration is a permanent scope (never
auto-expires) that removal can still dispose — Colossus Slayer is such a rider.
