"""Range checking and AoE origin derivation helpers.

These functions were originally private methods on CombatSystem.  They live
here so the spatial logic can be tested independently and reused without
importing the combat subsystem.

Keeping them in a dedicated file (rather than geometry.py) avoids a circular
import: geometry.py is imported by Entity, and Entity is imported here.
