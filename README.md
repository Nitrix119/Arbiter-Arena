# Arbiter Arena

**A deterministic evaluation harness for tool-using LLM agents, built on an SRD 5.1-compatible tactical combat engine.**

An agent proposes an action; the engine validates it against the rules, executes it, and records exactly what happened and why — so an agent's reliability can be measured rather than eyeballed. The underlying simulator is fully data-driven: every creature, spell, and rule is defined in JSON, with no code changes required to add content.

## Features

- **Full D&D 5e Combat**: Initiative tracking, turn order, and a complete action economy (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement speed).
- **Weapon Attacks**: Hit rolls against AC with typed damage formulas (e.g. `"1d8+3"` slashing).
- **Spell Effects Pipeline**: A sequential step-based pipeline handling attack rolls, saving throws, damage, healing, temporary HP, stat modifiers, status conditions, and persistent entity effects.
- **Area-of-Effect Spells**: Spatial geometry engine enforces AoE shapes (sphere, cone, line, cylinder, cube) and auto-selects targets inside the blast.
- **Legendary Actions**: Creatures can spend legendary action points outside their normal turn.
- **Damage Modifiers**: Per-creature vulnerability, resistance, and immunity to all 5e damage types, enforced by the global rule engine.
- **Entity Effects and Conditions**: Concentration tracking, buff/debuff effects that add modifiers or grant additional actions, and status conditions with durations.
- **Data-Driven Content**: Creatures, spells, and rules are JSON files — add or modify content without touching Python.
- **Web UI with Live Combat**: FastAPI backend with WebSocket sessions drives a canvas-based front-end. Combat state is streamed to the browser in real time.
- **Spell Animations**: A declarative JSON animation system controls canvas visual effects (projectiles, expanding rings, cones, beams, particles, flashes, auras) without any JavaScript changes.

## Defining Content

All creatures, spells, and animations are defined in JSON. Three reference guides cover the full format:

| Guide | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Creature Definition Guide](examples/creatures/CREATURE_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md) | Stat blocks, ability scores, saving throws, actions, spellcasting, legendary actions, damage modifiers, resource defaults |
| [Spell & Action Definition Guide](examples/spells/SPELL_DEFINITION_GUIDE.md) | Weapon attacks, spell top-level fields, the full effects pipeline (`attack_roll`, `saving_throw`, `damage`, `healing`, `add_entity_effect`, `apply_condition`, `add_modifier`, `grant_temporary_hp`), and the expression sandbox |
| [Animation Guide](examples/spells/ANIMATION_GUIDE.md) | Phase/effect structure, all seven canvas effect types (`projectile`, `expanding_ring`, `expanding_cone`, `flash`, `aura`, `particles`, `beam`), location references, and ready-made recipes by spell pattern |

### Quick example — loading a creature in Python

```python
from src.loaders import StatBlockLoader
from src.models import Entity
from src.combat import CombatSystem

goblin_block = StatBlockLoader.load_from_json("examples/creatures/goblin.json")
wizard_block = StatBlockLoader.load_from_json("examples/creatures/characters/wizard.json")

goblin = Entity(goblin_block)
wizard = Entity(wizard_block, is_player_controlled=True, team="players")

combat = CombatSystem()
combat.add_combatant(goblin)
combat.add_combatant(wizard)
combat.start_combat()
```

Spells listed in `known_spells` are resolved from the spell registry, which is populated at startup by scanning `examples/spells/`. Spell actions can also be embedded directly in a creature's `"actions"` array.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Core library only
pip install -e .

# With web server and dev tools
pip install -e ".[web,dev]"
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

---

## Running the Web UI

```bash
uvicorn web.app:app --reload
```

Or on Windows:

```bat
serve.bat
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser. The front-end connects over WebSocket and streams live combat events as they are resolved.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Event bus**: Combat actions publish typed events (`ATTACK_DECLARED`, `DAMAGE_DEALT`, `CONDITION_APPLIED`, etc.) through a central `EventBus`. Entity effects and global rules subscribe to events and can intercept or modify them before resolution.
- **Effects pipeline**: Each spell carries a sequential list of pipeline steps. Steps share an ephemeral context dictionary — earlier steps (e.g. `attack_roll`) write values (`context.hit`, `context.damage_dealt`) that later steps (e.g. `damage`, `healing`) can read and branch on.
- **Expression sandbox**: Conditional and computed fields in the pipeline accept sandboxed Python expression strings evaluated at runtime. These have access to `event.caster`, `event.defender`, and the pipeline `context`, but disallow assignments, imports, and any access to private attributes.
- **Rule engine**: Global rules (e.g. damage modifiers) and named entity effects (e.g. `haste`, `charmed`) are loaded from JSON at startup and applied by a `RuleEngine` that holds a handler registry. Handlers are keyed by action type (`AddModifier`, `ApplyCondition`, `GrantAction`, etc.).

---

## Future Goals

- **LLM-powered creature action selection**: Rather than using a simple heuristic, the combat engine will call an LLM at each non-player turn to decide which action a creature takes. The model will receive the current combat state — the acting creature's available actions, the positions and condition of all combatants, remaining resources — and return a structured action choice. This brings emergent, tactically interesting behaviour to monster turns without hand-scripted AI trees.
- Spell slot upcasting with structured higher-level scaling (damage riders per slot level above base).
- Multiattack — spending one action to make several attack rolls.
- Reaction support (e.g. Shield, Opportunity Attack) triggered by event bus hooks.
- Party vs. party matchmaking with configurable team compositions.
- Equipment and magic item stat modifiers.
- YAML alternative to JSON for stat blocks.
